# 2b2t-EFLY-UPDATED
Hello! This is my official updated elytraflight config for Lambda Client and Future Client.

If you would like to use this config. Follow the instructions below.

With both Future Client and Lambda Client installed and running ingame. (Please verify by pressing shift, and then closing future, then press y, and close lambda)

type (or paste) into chat.
( LOW PING / 140MS OR LOWER ) ".flight speed 43.2"
( HIGH PING / 140MS - 500MS ) ".flight speed 40.2"
( MUST USE FOR EVERYBODY ) ".timer speed 0.9"
Be sure to open the Future GUI and bind all of these features to a bind of your choice! I picked "G"

Next up, open Lambda (press y) and copy all of my enteries from this screenshot. - https://imgur.com/a/ZAB6kq7
To change a value to a speciic value (ie, forward pitch) right click on the value and then type in (-2, etc). 
DO NOT MESS WITH PAGE SETTINGS, KEEP IT TO GENERIC. 
BE SURE TO BIND ELYTRAFLIGHT TO THE SAME BIND AS YOU BINDED YOUR FUTURE MODULES! 

You are all done! Go have some fun elytraflying around 2b2t!
If you have any questions feel free to dm me on discord nxex#0001.
